# iot_device_simulator
Python assignment project (elte 2023/2)

👋 Hello! Welcome to my IoT Device Simulator Project!

🤖 This project aims to simulate an IoT device that sends sensor readings to a central server at a given URL. The device is built using Python and utilizes classes to represent the device, sensor, communication, and dashboard.

📈 The device sends sensor readings at a specified interval, and the dashboard plots the readings in real-time.

🧪 The project is tested using Python's built-in unittest module to ensure that each component works as expected.

🚀 To get started, clone the project and run the main.py file to simulate the device. You can customize the simulation by modifying the parameters passed to the Device class in the main.py file.

👨‍💻 Happy simulating!
